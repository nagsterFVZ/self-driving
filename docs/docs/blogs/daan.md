# Project Blog Daan van de Ven
## Week 1: 05-09-2022
This week I defined the project risks for the Plan of Approach. I worked on my personal development plan. With the group we started brainstorming for everything about the project.

## Week 2: 12-09-2022
This week I finished my PDP and we finished the first version of our plan of approach. 
I did research online about different types of chassis and their benefits. I started to model different types of gears and we started to print them to test their properties.

## Week 3: 19-09-2022
This week I started to model every component in Solidworks together with a 3mm thick plate as a basic chassis. The first visualisation of the cart was created with an assembly. 

## Week 4: 26-09-2022
This week I finished the final design of the differential. I found a big bearing from Arie in mechanical engineering. The first functioning version of the differential was made.

## Week 5: 03-10-2022
This week I finished the 4th version of the differential. We had a strong conversation with the group about not printing anymore components and first deciding on only sketching in solidworks. This way we werenâ€™t wasting anymore time with redoing the design process. We started to make a Kesselring method diagram for the chassis. And decided on a backbone structure.

## Week 6: 10-10-2022
This week I started to regain an overview of the project to descope myself from the differential. As I was very busy in the past two weeks due to moving to a new apartment. I am more focussed this week to look at the other aspects of the project and working more on my PDP.  

## Week 7: 17-10-2022
This week I was finishing the fifth version of the differential and printing it. I was also working on the axles which are only 4mm thick. I was working on it in the workshop with hand tools but I soon realised it should be done on the lathe. Working with the lathe took me quite some time.

## Week 8: 31-10-2022
This week I started to print version 5 of the Diff and the final gears. Hopefully this Differential will work as designed. I ordered the last Bearings from Arie. We had a meeting with the team to discuss everything we wanted to have finished before Thursday for the midterm.
## Week 9: 07-11-2022 - Midterm
This week I spoke with the Objexlab department to print the gears in SLA Tough 2000. Together with them we decided on the best print settings. These gears came out great.
The differential was assembled and worked great besides not being completely torqued down. This issue will be resolved in week 10.
## Week 10: 14-11-2022
This week I Learned how to use the cnc machine and made flat surfaces on the axles. This made me realise some design flaws in the axles. I am redesigning all the axles and I am going to produce them this week. I am hoping to have a functioning and ready to mount Differential by Monday next week. After that I will focus on something new.

## Week 11: 21-10-2022
This week I Finished the Differential. In its current form it will be used in the car and is being tested. My schedule for the project has cleared up a bit because the differential is finished, therefore I am starting a completely new aspect of the project which is learning how to use a generative design process for certain parts of the car.
## Week 12: 28-10-2022
This week we started to assemble the complete car. It made its first few actual metres on a flat surface with an ethernet cable connected. We came across various problems and improvements. I made flat surfaces on the axles to make sure the axle wasn't sliding through the set screws. I evaluated different parts of the wheel mounting system to remove a lot of play in this area. Furthermore I started to dive into the process of creating a generative design and gathering information to start doing calculations next week. 
## Week 13: 05-12-2022
This week I worked on My PDP to further explain the progress I have made so far on my goals. I made sure that various parts were updated for dual bearings and that they were printed. Together with Corne we ordered new parts that were broken or came in faulty. We reassembled the car with a new version of the chassis. I made sure the steering rods were aligned with the wheels. At the end of the week Floris was able to demo the steering motion with the servo.
## Week 14: 12-12-2022
This week I started with a little side project which was modelling the NXP track in solidworks so that Floris could use this with the unrealengine. With these models of the track pieces we are now able to create any track by combining the parts together in an assembly. The rest of the week I worked on the calculations and first generative design for the chassis components. This is still a big learning curve for me for fusion 360.

## Feedback Sessions
### Feedback Session: 22-09-2022
PDP was good except there were some wrong terms used to describe personal interests. These were resolved before the next meeting.
### Feedback Session:13-10-2022
My PDP revision was good and Wiely was positive about the Trello page. 
### Feedback Session: 08-12-2022
Feedback on the first soft skill for really pushing the team to make trello cards by Rane. Not being too easy on the team members. Feedback from Floris that the differential was one big manufacturing process that turned out great and is a good reason for finishing this hard skill.
