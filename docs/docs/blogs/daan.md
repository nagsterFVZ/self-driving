# Project Blog Daan van de Ven
## Week 1: 05-09-2022
This week I defined the project risks for the Plan of Approach. I worked on my personal development plan. With the group we started brainstorming for everything about the project.

## Week 2: 12-09-2022
This week I finished my PDP and we finished the first version of our plan of approach. 
I did research online about different types of chassis and their benefits. I started to model different types of gears and we started to print them to test their properties.

## Week 3: 19-09-2022
This week I started to model every component in Solidworks together with a 3mm thick plate as a basic chassis. The first visualisation of the cart was created with an assembly. 

## Week 4: 26-09-2022
This week I finished the final design of the differential. I found a big bearing from Arie in mechanical engineering. The first functioning version of the differential was made.

## Week 5: 03-10-2022
This week I finished the 4th version of the differential. We had a strong conversation with the group about not printing anymore components and first deciding on only sketching in solidworks. This way we werenâ€™t wasting anymore time with redoing the design process. We started to make a Kesselring method diagram for the chassis. And decided on a backbone structure.

## Week 6: 10-10-2022
This week I started to regain an overview of the project to descope myself from the differential. As I was very busy in the past two weeks due to moving to a new apartment. I am more focussed this week to look at the other aspects of the project and working more on my PDP.  

## Week 7: 17-10-2022
This week I was finishing the fifth version of the differential and printing it. I was also working on the axles which are only 4mm thick. I was working on it in the workshop with hand tools but I soon realised it should be done on the lathe. Working with the lathe took me quite some time.

## Week 8: 31-10-2022
This week I started to print version 5 of the Diff and the final gears. Hopefully this Differential will work as designed. I ordered the last Bearings from Arie. We had a meeting with the team to discuss everything we wanted to have finished before Thursday for the midterm.
