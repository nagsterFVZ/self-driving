# Project Blog Laurens Nauta
## Week 1: 05-09-2022
During this week we started the project. For me this week was mostly to get to know the members of my group and to get an overview of the project. 

## Week 2: 12-09-2022
This week I mostly worked on the Plan Of Approach (POA). I also worked on my Personal Development Plan (PDP), in which I set apart my personal goals for this project.

## Week 3: 19-09-2022
I mostly worked on the preliminary research for the chassis and drivetrain.

## Week 4: 26-09-2022
This week we continued the research. I wasted some time due to not really being able to concentrate.


## Week 5: 03-10-2022
Finishing research, doing some random bits of work on the project. This was a bad week for me, as I had trouble concentrating. Coming weekend I will work on clearing my head so next week will go better.

## Week 6: 10-10-2022
Start on designing the steering mechanism. I first need to learn how to work with Solidworks. I’m used to Siemens NX, so that might take two days or so.

## Week 7: 17-10-2022
Finishing designing the steering mechanism. I can now sufficiently work in Solidworks. Starting writing on the research for the steering.

## Week 8: 31-10-2022
Work on finishing the steering research. Next to that, preparing to print everything and start a first assembly. preparation for the midterm

## Week 9: 07-11-2022 - Midterm
This week I worked on some documentation and the steering. We also had the midterm, however I had no part in presenting or preparing the presentation. It was nice to see all the projects of the other groups, some of which I had not seen for a long time.

## Week 10: 14-11-2022
The beginning of this week was difficult. After the midterm I did not really know what the next step for me was. The steering was basically done, just some documentation left. next to that we had some discussion about the chassis. I'm of the opinion that we should make more changes and don’t keep going on an older idea.
