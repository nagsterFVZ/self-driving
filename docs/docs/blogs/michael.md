## Week 1: 05-09-2022
We as a group have been working on the code of conduct and individually have been working on the pdpâ€™s.

## Week 2: 12-09-2022
I have been working on the POA chapter: Phasing and I have started on research for the sensors. As a group we have had brainstorms about how we want the car to work.

## Week 3: 19-09-2022
I have been doing research about and choosing the sensors we want to use.

## Week 4: 26-09-2022
This week I have not done anything specific I have mostly been supporting where necessary.

## Week 5: 03-10-2022
This week I have been working on the prototype of the electrical system and I have been working on the formula to transform the detected voltage from the NTC into a temperature.

## Week 6: 10-10-2022
I have been working on the electrical system and on the Requirements Document

## Week 7: 17-10-2022
I have been looking into the Pynq Z2 and the possibility of accelerating line detection using the Pynq

## Week 8: 31-10-2022
I have been working on how to program the Pynq Z2.

## Week 9: 7-11-2022
I have been working on the presentation.

## Week 10: 14-11-2022
I have been working on troubleshooting why the software used to program the Pynq z2, doesn't work.

## Week 11: 21-11-2022
I have been helping Floris with the software. But was not the most productive week for me.

## Week 12: 28-11-2022
I have mostly been acting as tech support with most of my time being spended on cleaning and recalibrating the 3d printer

## Week 13: 5-12-2022
I have mostly been working on a few algorithems for Floris and have been started with creating a script to read data from the lidar.

## Week 14: 12-12-2022
I have completed a script that transforms the output from the lidar into 2 arryas of data that contain the angles and distance respectively. And I have started working on a script to reda the Hall-effect sensors.
