# Project Blog Rane van de Pas
## Week 1: 05-09-2022
Orienting in what we want to achieve and splitting our tasks, start writing our personal development plan.
## Week 2: 12-09-2022
Finishing writing my pdp and making the plan of approach with the team. Also starting research on differentials and steering. 
## Week 3: 19-09-2022
Researching gear ratio’s and different types of gears. (Spur, helical and V-gears)
## Week 4: 26-09-2022
Researching car suspension, designing front suspension of the car (double wishbone suspension).
## Week 5: 03-10-2022
Adjusting suspension to fit our specifications (20cm width) and researching steering on our car.
## Week 6: 10-10-2022
Putting the parts we have so far in SolidWorks, designing rear suspension and thinking about how to power the rear wheels
## Week 7: 17-10-2022
Visualizing the steering, dampers and drivetrain in CAD. (Documenting at home since public transport is striking again).
## Week 8: 31-10-2022
Finishing the rear suspension mounts, mounts for differential and the last finishing touches of the frame for the first prototype print.

## Week 9: 07-11-2022 - Midterm
Assembling the prototype of the chassis, writing down problems we find so we can fix those. Midterm preparations.
## Week 10: 14-11-2022
This week Tom and I focussed on improving the turning circle of our car, we couldn’t make it round a 180 degree turn on the nxp track. First we made an adapter plate for our servo saver to create a larger center distance from the servo, this would greatly increase the turning radius.![Servo adapterplate](./images/Servo-adapterplate.jpg)
Second thing we improved was the chassis, we shortened the wheelbase by around 2.5 centimeters and the total length of the car was reduced by around 4.5 centimeters.![New Chassis assembly](./images/New-Chassis.jpg)
