# Differential

## Differential V1

### Design considerations

During the design phase of the differential there are several factors that are subject to change during the design process. If the differential is to be mounted inside the same housing as the motor the whole housing design should be halted until a decision is made. Furthermore the mounting system for components on the aluminium frame is still to be decided. For this first version it is clear that there will be more iterations. With this model the bearings that we brought to school that were salvaged from old fidget spinners were used in the design.

### Evaluation

Upon mounting these bearings the side wall broke apart making the print unusable. The gear on the base came out great. The full function of the differential is not possible in this design. There needs to be another gear opposite of the middle gear. These middle gears will drive the shafts to the wheel. The side gears are there to accommodate a rotational speed difference between these two shafts. This is the main function of a differential.

### Improvements for next version

The next version will need to have thicker walls on the base for better strength. The gears will need to be printed to test them for smooth operating and interlocking properties.

## Differential V2

### Design considerations

For the second version of the differential the wall thickness was increased, the hole dimensions were increased to accommodate the bearings and chamfers and round edges were added to create a more finished look and feel. The chamfers also help with guiding the bearing in the hole in a straight manner. This version had finished printing on 29/09/2022. As is seen on the Photo to the right, the bearings fit mostly the way it was meant to be fitted. But most importantly it functions.

### Evaluation

This was the first time the differential could be tested for its functions. The gears do move eachother but the motion is very obstructed and grindy. This is a problem since we want the differential to be a smooth system with very low friction. Where there is friction there is heat and energy loss.

### Improvements for next version

Any refinements to the spacings and tolerances should be addressed in further versions. The gears need to be redesigned. The spacing between the gears needs to be looked at. Anything that will create friction needs to be redesigned or evaluated to improve it.

## Differential V3

### Design considerations

For this version of the Differential the main improvements were to enclose the whole assembly in a cage that would provide a volume for the grease within the gears. Also another reason for enclosing the base was to provide a strong structure for it to be printed in two different parts that would be joined together with four bolts and nuts. The reason for printing in two halves was that the bearing holes would be printed more accurately since there wasnâ€™t a need for support structure within these cavities when printing in two parts.

### Evaluation

This differential gave the team quite a headache. Actually after having tested the differential we quickly came to the conclusion that V2 was still moving much better. This was yet again due to clearance issues within the model and printing on different 3d printers.

### Improvements for next version

The big improvement that needs to be realised for the next version is the size. The team has come to a conclusion that the differential must be significantly smaller in size to even be used in the car chassis design. The current version is too big and it will not fit in any way or it will hit the ground. This and the friction issues must be fixed in a next itteration.

## Differential V4

### Design considerations

8.8mm + 2.2mm = 11 mm axle length for side gears

28 teeth on the main gear.

The fourth version of the differential has to be significantly smaller than the previous versions. To accomplish this I have started to model the gears. The size of the gears will determine the total size of the differential.

Size of side bearings: Id 10mm Od 26mm width 8mm code: 6000

### Evaluation

Since this version was not printed there will not be any practical assessment of its functions.

### Improvements for next version

Recreate the old idea of creating the base out of two halves and joining them together with bolts and nuts.

## Differential V5

### Design considerations

For the 5th version of the differential the body structure was changed to a split body configuration. For this to function the body was altered with 2 more structures for the bolts and nuts. Since this differential design was likely to succeed the team decided to print it in PETG at the Objexlab. This material is better suited for higher temperature loads, since the standard PLA starts to deteriorate in strength from 50 degrees celsius and up.

## Evaluation

When the gears were printed in the SLA printer in a material called Tough 2000 the Team's expectations were quite good, but after having printed several different versions of the gear the team does have its concerns about the elastic properties of the material. It seems to be a very brittle material but probably high in compressive strength. This will be a problem for the use case of the gears.

## Improvements for next version

There are a few aspects to this design that still need to be improved. First of all, the gears inside will be printed in an SLA printer, this is a resin printer that hardens the resin with a laser. This printer has a few distinct advantages over conventional filament printers. The product has much finer build layers. With a printer like this you can print from 100 all the way down to 25 micrometres. This printer is also much more precise than a filament printer which translates in a higher surface quality on the product.
