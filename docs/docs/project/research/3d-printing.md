# 3D Printing

For the prototyping phase of the project 3d printing is a good and probably necessary medium. In this document the different 3d printing techniques will be compared and studied to give the best solutions to the project.
Prototyping
For the experimental prototyping phase there are multiple options here at fontys. It is essential that the team can create models in Cad Programs and start printing them right away on site. Downstairs at the Mechanical engineering department there is a room full of 3D printers ready to print for everyone in the building. However there are a number of reasons why this 3d printing department is not suitable for the Becreative project. With luck from the Project manager the team is allowed to use the Prusa MK3 that is located in the Becreative room. This makes experimental prototyping very efficient for the self-driving car team.
